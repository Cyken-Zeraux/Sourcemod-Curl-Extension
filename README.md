##Origin
This project was originally created by Rayden over at code.google.com/p/sourcemod-curl-extension and published on the AlliedModders
forum. The project had not been updated since 2011, not documented, and was still hosted on the depcrecated Google Code platform.
Because of the nature of networking, cURL and its dependencies require security fixes along with usage of new authentication features.
This was not being provided in any form by the author, and so it was forked to this project.
